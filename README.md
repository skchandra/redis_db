Project Goal: 

Our team goals are to learn about database implementation and data structures for Project 2. Utilizing the IMDb database, we are replicating the Oracle of Bacon using Redis and IMDb’s Top 250 Movies’ Actors. With Redis, we want to be able to make our own graphs, data structures and functions into Redis. After using Redis, we want to go one more step back and learn how to implement a database system like Redis.
