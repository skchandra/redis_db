<h2>Project Goals</h2>
  <p>Our team goals are to learn about database implementation and data structures for Project 2. Utilizing the IMDb database, we are replicating the Oracle of Bacon using Redis and IMDb’s Top 250 Movies’ Actors. With Redis, we want to be able to make our own graphs, data structures and functions into Redis. After using Redis, we want to go one more step back and learn how to implement a database system like Redis.
  </p>

<h2>Sprint 1</h2>

<h3>IMDB Data Collection</h3>
  <p>First, we had to learn about how to collect IMDB data. We decided to focus on the filmography of actors that have a movie in the IMDb Top 250 movies list. This is the process we went through:</p>
  <img src="images/get_IMDB_data.jpg">
  <p>We stored the list of top 250 movies from the imdb database in a dictionary using the movie ids as keys and the movie titles as values. We then used the movie ids to query the imdb database for the full information about each movie in the top 250 movies. This database call gave us the cast of each of the movies. Many movies have very large casts, so we only used the first 10 cast members in the list. We queried the database for the filmography of each actor / actress, or the list of all the movies they have been in. We then built a redis database, setting the actor / actress’s id as the key and setting the value to a tuple consisting of their name and filmography. We chose to use ids as keys because we wanted to be confident that we were using a unique identifier even if the actors / actresses had the same name.</p>

  <p> The code for getting each actor and their entire filmography into redis can be found here: <a style="color:green" href="https://github.com/skchandra/redis_db/blob/gh-pages/sprint1_usingredis.ipynb">Sprint 1 Version of Data Wrangling</a></p>

<h3>Our Redis Knowledge</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We all read <a href="http://openmymind.net/2011/11/8/Redis-Zero-To-Master-In-30-Minutes-Part-1/">Redis Zero to Master in 30 Minutes Part 1</a></li>
    <li>Redis is a data structure engine, where a value can only be accessed by a key</li>
    <li>Can add data structures the same way the 5 that are already there exist</li>
    <li>All you need is implementation and commands to access it!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li>Read through and working on implementing example of adding an AVL tree data structure to Redis: <a href="http://www.starkiller.net/2013/05/02/hacking-redis-adding-a-command/">Hacking Redis: Adding a Command</a></li>
    <li>Need to add commands to access it</li>
    <li>Implement in separate file, and require it in redis.h</li>
    <li>Define structure</li>
    <li>Define management functions</li>
    <li>Define outward facing commands</li>
    <li>Actual implementation (graph class in C as described below)</li>
    <li>Persistence-- RDB and or Append Only File</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>We plan to create a graph class in C and write methods to implement this data structure in Redis. We are looking into testing both adjacency lists and adjacency matrices to both see which would better suit our needs and increase our overall knowledge. In terms of implementing these features in Redis, we are thinking about either creating a local Redis file with our graph program, or directly contributing to Redis, potentially through hiredis (its C interface).</li>
    <li>Once we have the graph data structure in Redis, we will create a new database with it in order to be able to traverse through actors/actresses and movies to find connections between them. We decided that it would be easiest to start by instituting Kevin Bacon as the starting point of our graph and creating our version of the Oracle of Bacon.</li>
    <li>After we have a working implementation for the Bacon Number, we will develop a more general search algorithm which can be applied to search between any two actors/actresses and return the connection between them. Because this is a more broad problem and we are interested in learning more about search algorithms, we will look at depth first search, breadth first search, and bidirectional search in order to be able to see the pros and cons of each.</li>  
  </ul>
</p>


<h2>Sprint 2</h2>

<h3> Re-Evaluated Project Steps</h3>

  <p>Coming into sprint 2, we had to re-evaluate our project goals and steps, in order to achieve what we want to learn more efficiently. While we were planning out algorithms and data structures we could use for creating graph/searching. As a result, we scrapped our original idea of using each actor's entire filmography and instead just looked at actors and their films that are in the top 250 movies. <br>
  <ul>Steps we are now doing: 
  <li>Create a dictionary of each top 250 movie as a key, and the top 10 actors for each movie as the corresponding value.</li>
  <li>Use the dictionary to make adjacency lists of each actor and all of the actors that share the same filmography in the top 250 movies list</li>
  <li>Use bi-directional breadth-first search to our adjacency lists to find shortest path between two actors</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

<h3>What We Did This Sprint </h3>
  <p>Code for making the adjacency lists and putting them into Redis: <a href="https://github.com/skchandra/redis_db/blob/gh-pages/Using_Redis.ipynb">Making Adjacency Lists in Redis</a> <br>
  We also started looking at how to make redis commands.
  <ul>
    These are the sources we found: 
    <li><a href="http://openmymind.net/Writing-A-Custom-Redis-Command-In-C-Part-1/">Writing a Custom Redis Command in C</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.heychinaski.com/blog/2013/10/14/a-look-at-the-redis-source-code/">Looking at the Redis Source Code</a></li>    
  </ul> <br>
  Next, we tried making out own Redis commands and replicating the ping pong command in redis. We got a little stuck during this sprint, but will devote all of next sprint to get this working</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Now that we have created a data structure and framework to store the actors and their corresponding actors, we are working on integrating these structures into Redis directly. Currently, we are treating each actor as a key and appending each corresponding actor as a value in a list. We are now in the process of figuring out how to add commands into Redis, and once we do that, will be able to add a command to search between two of the actors in our table.
</li>
  <li>In terms of searching, we will start out with breadth first search for simplicity and pick one actor/actress to act as the head node. The function we write will allow us to search for the degrees of separation from that particular actor to any other actor.</li>
  <li>Once we have breadth first search working, we will implement bidirectional search, which is slightly more complicated to setup and code. This will allow us to choose two head nodes (any two actors) and locate the shortest path between them. 
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2> Sprint 3</h2>
<h3>Breadth-First Search in Python</h3>
<p> We spent a lot of time this sprint not looking further at storing data, but understanding data structures and search algorithms. We created our own working breadth-first search algorithm, and made sure it worked with our data in redis.</p>
<pre>
def bfs(graph, start, end):
    # maintain a queue of paths
    queue = []
    # push the first path into the queue
    queue.append([start])
    while queue:
        # get the first path from the queue
        path = queue.pop(0)
        # get the last node from the path
        node = path[-1]
        # path found
        if node == end:
            return path
        # enumerate all adjacent nodes, construct a new path and push it into the queue
        for adjacent in graph.get(node, []):
            new_path = list(path)
            new_path.append(adjacent)
            queue.append(new_path)
</pre>

<h2>Sprint 4</h2>
<h3>Sprint Goals</h3>
<h3>Breadth-First Search in C</h3>
<h3>Bi-Directional Search in C</h3>
<h3>Working More with Multiple Redis Databases</h3>
  <p>Once we had breadth-first search working, we wanted to be able to have actual actor names, instead of just actual actor ids. At the same time, we wanted to be able to implement that into the redis command, and have it done in C.
  <ul>Steps For Having Actor Names Implemented:
  <li>Get Key-Value File System in redis server with actor name as key, and actor id as value. This is for taking in an actor name first, converting it into id's, which is how our adjacency list is comprised of.</li>
  <li>Get Key-Value File System in redis server with actor id as key, and actor name as value. This is for getting the final display of the degrees of separation path.</li>
  <li>Write code for switching between 3 different databases to do the three different parts of the algorithm: 1. Get actor names from argument of command, and use name-to-id lookup table to get the start and end id's. 2. Do search algorithm with the actor id's. 3. Use the id-to-name lookup table to print out the path from start to end.</li>
  </ul>
  Using Python, we store all of the two lookup tables into the redis servers, and then use the switch command to access the other databases. Here is an example of the switch command: 
    <pre>
    
      //SETTING UP LOOKUP TABLE:
      redisReply *actors_ids;
      actors_ids = redisCommand(c, "SELECT 2");

      redisReply *switch_back;
      switch_back = redisCommand(c, "SELECT 0");
    </pre>
  We have to do this each time that we want to use different databases.
